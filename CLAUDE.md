# Saints CC — FIFA World Cup 2026 Sweepstake Tracker

Club sweepstake site for Saints CC (amateur cricket club). 48 tickets, 48 teams,
£180 pot. The draw happened 2026-06-11; the tournament is now running.

Prizes: £100 holder of the team that wins the final · £50 loses the final ·
£25 wins the third-place playoff · £5 wooden spoon (tournament's bottom team
by points → GD → GF → GA → fair play → FIFA ranking). The sim CANNOT compute
the spoon (it produces finishing orders, not scorelines/cards) — decision
agreed 2026-06-12: hard-code the spoon holder from real results once the
group stage finishes; do not simulate it. LOCKED 28 Jun: **Iraq, held by Ed
Marsh** (bottom of all 48 on GD, −11) — see roadmap item 5.

## Repo layout
- `site/` — static pages (Netlify publish dir)
  - `index.html` — main page: Saints-branded board of all 48 teams with ticket
    holders, click-through fun facts, win-probability badges. Was the pre-draw
    countdown page; being evolved into the live tournament tracker. Both the
    fixtures and results panels are scoped to the **current round** — derived from
    openfootball's per-match `round` field ("Matchday N" in the group stage,
    "Round of 32"/…/"Final" in the knockouts), where the current round is the round
    of the next match still to be played (the round of the last match once all are
    played). The panel headings carry the live round name (e.g. "Round of 32 —
    Fixtures" / "— Results"). The fixtures panel lists the round's upcoming
    (unplayed) matches sorted by date (soonest first), each with a per-match
    **win% from the Sports4cast feed** (`feedPairProb`/`feedReachStrength` — the
    same reach-next-round model the wall chart bracket uses, see Daily sim
    subsystem; Elo `eloWinPct` is the no-feed / tie fallback) and an "on TV in the
    UK" line sourced from `data/tv-uk.json` (see below); the "Recent Results" panel
    lists the round's played matches, most recent first, rendering the score via
    `scoreHtml(score)`: a knockout tie decided in extra time / on penalties shows
    the after-extra-time score marked `AET` with the shootout score underneath
    (`score.et`/`score.p` from openfootball) — so a 1–1 penalty tie no longer
    reads as an unresolved draw. In both panels the rows are grouped under match-day
    dividers (`.fday`, captioned e.g. "Tuesday 30 June") bucketed by the **UK
    (Europe/London, BST in summer) kickoff date** via `ukDate`/`ukDayLabel` — so a
    late US kickoff sits under the next day's header. **Both panels are collapsible**
    (one shared helper, `applyMatchCollapse` + `MATCH_PANELS`, reusing the odds-chart
    pattern: `.frows.collapsed .fold` + `#fixtureMore`/`#resultMore`). Collapsed, each
    shows a single UK match day — fixtures the soonest upcoming day (today, or the next
    day with games after a rest day), results the most recent day with results
    (`fxPivot`/`rePivot` = the `ukDate` of the first match after the soonest/most-recent
    sort, so it lines up with the dividers); rows **and their day header** on other
    days are tagged `.fold` and hidden. The "Show all N this
    round" toggle only appears when there's both a primary day and other days;
    a round whose remaining games are all on one day shows the full list and no
    toggle.
  - `draw.html` — the Draw Machine used live on draw day (slot-machine reveal,
    crypto-random, no-repeat pool, localStorage persistence). Job done; keep
    for posterity.
  - `favicon.png` — 64px Saints crest on maroon (`#5C1224`), linked by all
    three pages. Regenerate from the crest with the snippet in tools/ if the
    crest changes; it's the one non-embedded image asset.
  - `data/sweepstake.json` — **source of truth for the draw result**: tickets,
    people (grouped), team names + flag codes. Build new features from this,
    not by scraping the HTML.
  - `data/facts.json` — single copy of the 48 fun facts, keyed by SIM team
    name ("Turkey", "Curacao"), each entry `{code, name, fact}` carrying the
    flagcdn code + display name ("Türkiye", "Curaçao"). Both pages fetch it;
    don't reintroduce inline copies.
  - `data/tv-uk.json` — **curated** UK free-to-air broadcaster per match, keyed
    by the openfootball `num` (1–104). Each entry `{channel, stream?}` e.g.
    `{"channel":"BBC One","stream":"BBC iPlayer"}`; `"TBC"` renders a muted
    "UK channel to be confirmed" hint, a missing entry renders nothing.
    index.html's fixtures panel shows it as the "on TV" line under each upcoming
    match. There is **no open feed** carrying this (decision 29 Jun, after
    confirming openfootball has no broadcaster field and TheSportsDB's is
    sparse/crowdsourced + rate-limited), so it's hand-curated from the BBC/ITV
    confirmations (broadcastnow.co.uk / live-footballontv.com) — same pattern as
    facts.json and the hard-coded spoon. BBC & ITV split the 104 games 50/50 and
    both show the final. R32 (num 73–88) is confirmed (8 BBC / 8 ITV), R16
    (89–96) is confirmed (4 BBC / 4 ITV: BBC 89/92/93/94, ITV 90/91/95/96) and
    QF (97–100) is confirmed (8 Jul: BBC 98 only, ITV 97/99/100 — ITV took three
    of the four, so it is **not** a 2/2 split; don't "fix" it to even out); SF
    (101–102) and 3rd place (103) stay `"TBC"` until broadcasters confirm them
    round-by-round; the Final (104) is on both. Keyed
    by `num` (not teams) so it survives knockout placeholders like "W74".
  - `wallchart.html` — interactive groups + bracket. People-first labels:
    owner names label group rows, bracket cards and the champion box; the
    country lives in a hover/tap "team card" (flag, country, holder, champion
    % from daily-sim.json with the in-page Elo model as fallback, fun fact).
    Tapping a FLAG pins the card; tapping the rest of a bracket row still
    advances the team — keep that split, it's what preserves tap-to-advance
    on touch. **Real knockout results lock the bracket**: on load it fetches
    openfootball's `worldcup.json` (same feed index.html uses), and
    `buildKoResults`/`applyKoResults` match each played tie (match `num` ≥ 73)
    to its bracket slot by team-pair, lock the real winner into `kwins` and the
    score into `koScore[slotId]` (`{a,b,aet,pa,pb}`), re-locking on every
    `renderKO()`. Locked ties are immutable — `pickWinner` and the KO autosim
    (`_koAfSet`/`_koAfClear`) skip any slot with a `koScore`, and `applyKoResults`
    runs before the init autosim so an upset (e.g. a penalty winner) propagates
    into the R16+ pre-fill instead of the model's favourite. A played card shows
    the real goals (after extra time if it went to ET), the shootout score in
    parens and a small `aet` tag instead of the win %. worldcup.json carries
    `score.ft`/`score.et`/`score.p`; three team names differ from ours, mapped by
    `OF_NAME` (Bosnia & Herzegovina / Curaçao / Czech Republic). On load it `postMessage`s the parent two things: `s4c-height`
    (iframe auto-height) and `s4c-champ-dist` (its champion distribution, feed
    if loaded else the in-page model) — the latter is index.html's middle-tier
    odds fallback (see Daily sim subsystem). Group finishing positions are set
    by clicking probability cells directly (`assignPosition`); there is no
    separate position-picker modal.
- `netlify/functions/sports4cast.mjs` — API proxy (see Security)
- `netlify.toml` — publish dir + functions dir

## Architecture rules
1. **Static site + one serverless proxy. No other backend.** Keep costs at £0
   (Netlify free tier).
2. The browser NEVER calls Sports4cast directly. It calls `/api/chances`
   (also `/api/fixtures`, `/api/rankings`) on same-origin, served by the proxy.
3. The proxy CDN-caches until the next **06:30 Europe/London** (upstream data
   refreshes ~04:00). Target ~1 upstream call/day. Don't add schedulers or
   storage; the cache header approach is deliberate.
4. The proxy is a closed allowlist of three endpoints — never make it an open
   relay.

## Security — non-negotiable
- API key lives ONLY in Netlify env var `SPORTS4CAST_KEY` (locally: `.env`,
  which is gitignored). Never in code, never in git history, never client-side,
  never echoed in errors or logs.
- The original key was exposed in chat during development → treated as burned.
  The owner (a friend of Kit's) is issuing a fresh one. **Current status: the
  old key returns 403 from upstream — expected. Do not debug this; it needs the
  new key in the env var.**
- If a key is ever pasted into a chat/commit/log again: rotate it.

## External API (friend's service — Sports4cast)
- Base: `https://sports4cast-api-oxtgcqhyuq-nw.a.run.app`
- Auth: `x-api-key` header.
- `GET /wc2026/chances` — per-team tournament advancement probabilities.
  **Schema not yet confirmed** — no successful call has been made. First task
  once a working key exists: capture a real response and pin down field names.
- `GET /fixtures`, `GET /rankings` — shapes also unconfirmed.

## Known gotchas (learned the hard way)
- **Team-name mapping is the #1 silent-failure risk.** The API's team strings
  may differ from ours ("Turkey"/"Türkiye", "Korea Republic"/"South Korea",
  "Côte d'Ivoire"/"Ivory Coast", "Czech Republic"/"Czechia",
  "Bosnia-Herzegovina"/"Bosnia & Herz.", "United States"/"USA",
  "Congo DR"/"DR Congo"). Build a normalisation map keyed from the REAL
  response, and make the UI display unmatched teams loudly — never default a
  missed join to 0%.
- Emoji flags render as letter codes on Windows — that's why all 48 flags are
  embedded base64 PNGs in the pages. Keep it that way (works offline too).
- `draw.html` uses localStorage (key `saints-wc-draw-v1`) to survive refreshes.
- **Children of `.chart-wrap` must NOT reuse its `max-width:760px;width:94vw`.**
  That sizing is for the panel itself; the panel has `1.4rem` side padding, so a
  child forced to the same width can't fit its content box — its `auto` margins
  collapse to a negative right margin and it overflows ~45px to the right. Let
  panel children fill the content box (`width:auto`), like `#chartRows`. It bit
  the spoon-watch pill once (the solid maroon `.locked` bg made the spill loud).
- **Grid/flex items need `min-width:0` or they overflow narrow screens.** A grid
  item defaults to `min-width:auto`, so a `1fr` track can't shrink below its
  content's min-content — text with `overflow:hidden`+`text-overflow:ellipsis`
  never truncates and the columns blow past the viewport. It bit the 3rd-place
  `.t3btn` grid on mobile (3 cols ran ~32px off the right). Fix: `min-width:0`
  on the grid/flex item itself, not just the inner `.t3-name`.
- Pages embed logo + flags (self-contained rendering) but index.html and
  wallchart.html now FETCH same-origin data: `data/facts.json`,
  `data/daily-sim.json`, `data/tv-uk.json` (+ the GCS wc2026.json) — and both
  also fetch openfootball's `worldcup.json` (index for fixtures/results,
  wallchart for the real KO ties). All fetches degrade gracefully — facts modal
  shows a fallback line, champion % falls back to the in-page model, chart falls
  back to the snapshot, the TV line just doesn't render, and without worldcup.json
  the bracket just stays on the model's prediction. Keep it that way.

## Branding (use these, don't invent)
- Maroon primary `#5C1224` / deep `#43091A`; green secondary `#0E2A1F` /
  panel `#0A1F16`; cream `#F2EAD3`; gold trim `#D9A93C` / soft `#B8902F`.
- Fonts: Tangerine (Monotype Corsiva stand-in) for display; Saira Condensed
  for labels/uppercase; Spectral for body.
- Tone: cricket-club scoreboard aesthetic, gold-highlighted key words.
  In-jokes that are canon: "Lambrini Moment" (worst moment award),
  Jaffa (the dog) holds Australia.

## Roadmap (in order)
1. **[BLOCKED on new API key]** Capture real `/wc2026/chances` response;
   build team-name normaliser + unmatched-team warning.
2. [DONE 12 Jun] **"Who's winning" chart**: one gold bar per person = summed
   champion %. The sim's modal podium pays out 🏆 £100 / 🥈 £50 / 🥉 £25,
   shown as a medal (left) + £ amount (beside the name) on the three holders
   only. The payout still drives the sort (prize-winners first, then by bar)
   — it is NOT drawn as a second bar (tried it; cream Bar B added noise, Kit
   cut it 12 Jun). Collapsed to the top 20 with a "Show all 33 people" toggle
   (`#chartRows.collapsed` + `#chartMore` button; `chartExpanded` persists
   across re-renders). Fun-fact badges hydrate from daily-sim.json, falling
   back to static `WINPROB`. Possible later toggle: "chance of holding a
   finalist" from stage probabilities.
3. [DONE — built from Kit's supplied HTML] **Wall chart** with people-first
   labels + team cards. [DONE 30 Jun] **Real knockout results lock in** from
   openfootball's `worldcup.json` (not `/api/fixtures` — that proxy is dead on
   the burned key, and worldcup.json already carries `ft`/`et`/`p` per match):
   `buildKoResults`/`applyKoResults` join played ties to bracket slots and lock
   the winner + score (incl. extra-time + penalty). index.html's "Recent Results"
   shows AET / penalty scores via `scoreHtml`. Group standings still come from the
   daily-sim p1–p4 (already collapsed to 0/100 once a group finishes), which is
   what lines the R32 matchups up with the real ties.
4. Retire countdown remnants on index.html as tracker features land.
5. [DONE 28 Jun] **Wooden spoon** locked from real results. All six bottom
   teams finished the group stage on 0 pts, so goal difference settled it:
   **Iraq −11** (GF 1, GA 12) — one goal worse than Tunisia (−10) — holder
   **Ed Marsh**. Hard-coded as `FINAL_SPOON` in `sim/simulate.mjs` (`spoon.final
   = true`, per-candidate gf/ga/gd from the real tables, scorelines in the code
   comment, cross-checked vs ESPN/FIFA/Sky/Al Jazeera). index.html: the
   spoon-watch banner switches to the locked £5 result when `spoon.final`, and
   the holder gets a 🥄 + £5 badge on a `.crow.spoon` row pinned to the bottom
   of the odds chart (kept visible when collapsed via `:not(.spoon)`). If real
   results are ever found to differ, edit `FINAL_SPOON` and rerun the sim.

## Daily sim subsystem
- `sim/simulate.mjs` builds the daily odds (default 10,000 sims, seed =
  today's date) and writes `site/data/daily-sim.json`. With an official feed it
  takes the headline numbers straight from Sports4cast and does NOT simulate the
  tournament; the full Monte Carlo runs only in deep fallback (see below).
  `.github/workflows/daily-sim.yml` runs it ~05:14 UK daily (deliberately early
  — GitHub often dispatches scheduled runs hours late) and commits the result,
  which redeploys Netlify.
- The sim EXTRACTS its model from site/wallchart.html at runtime (vm + DOM
  stubs) — Elo, winProb, co-host boost, bracket slots, third-place allocation.
  One source of truth: never duplicate those tables into the sim.
- With a feed present (the normal case): champion, runner-up and every exit
  stage come straight from the feed's `chances.*`; the predicted bracket and the
  `modal` podium advance each knockout by the feed's **reach-next-round**
  probability — the chance of winning THAT match, which Sports4cast itself shows.
  It's read off the chances exit-distribution (group/r32/r16/qf/sf/final/win sum
  to 100): an R32 winner's strength is `r16+qf+sf+final+win` (reach the R16), an
  R16 winner's is `qf+sf+final+win`, … and the final's is `win`. Do NOT use
  `chances.win` for a match — that's the whole-tournament odds and makes every
  favourite look near-certain (Argentina 100% over Cape Verde vs the feed's ~89%).
  The champion is still the feed's predicted winner (the final's strength IS
  `chances.win`). The ONLY match the sim resolves itself is the third-place
  playoff between the two losing semifinalists (our one-match Elo model — the feed
  gives no head-to-head for it). Group orders / qualifying thirds (weighted by
  p3q) are still sampled from the daily p1–p4/p3q marginals, but ONLY to project
  the R32 third-slot hover distribution (raked back to p3q) — no knockout is
  simulated. NB the feed exposes no per-match head-to-head, so these reconstructed
  paths/percentages won't exactly equal Sports4cast's joint sim — close matches
  can flip and even ties differ by a few points.
- Deep fallback ONLY (feed unreachable >3 days, live GCS JSON → saved fixture →
  here): a full Monte Carlo off the wall chart's Elo snapshot — group orders from
  p1–p4, knockouts from winProb (no draws). Documented approximations — refine,
  don't silently change.
- daily-sim.json records per team: `champion`, `runnerUp`, `third` (each map
  sums to 100 — never renormalise) plus `stages` (incl. runnerUp/third) and
  `modal` = {champion, runnerUp, third} of the single most-likely playthrough.
- `modalScenario()` in the sim deliberately REPLICATES the wall chart's autosim
  (groups by p1, best-8 thirds by p3q, the higher reach-next-round team wins every
  KO match; only the third-place playoff goes to the Elo favourite) so the
  pre-filled wall chart and the index chart's "simulated draw" bar always tell
  the same story. The shared reach-next-round strength lives in `feedReachStrength`
  + `feedFavourite` (sim) / `feedReachStrength` + `feedPairProb` (wallchart.html)
  / `feedReachStrength` + `feedPairProb` (index.html, for the **fixtures-panel
  per-match win%** — keyed off the openfootball round via `STAGE_OF_ROUND`),
  with identical per-stage formulas and tie-handling; Elo is only the tie / no-feed
  fallback. If the autosim or per-match-odds logic in any of the three files
  changes, change the others to match.
- index.html odds-chart source priority: daily-sim.json → wall-chart
  postMessage champion dist → hard-coded snapshot. Medals + £ render only
  when `modal` is present (fallback sources draw the bar alone, no podium).

## Dev workflow
- **ALWAYS keep this file (CLAUDE.md) current.** Any change to architecture,
  data flow, the sim, the pages, or a documented behaviour MUST update the
  matching section of CLAUDE.md as part of the same change — not a follow-up,
  not "later". Stale docs here have actively misled work (e.g. the section once
  said knockouts use Elo `winProb` long after they switched to the feed's
  `chances.win`). Treat the doc edit as part of the task's definition of done.
- Local: `npm install`, then `npx netlify dev --offline` (add `.env` with
  `SPORTS4CAST_KEY=...` for a working proxy; without it `/api/*` returns the
  deliberate "Server not configured" 500).
- netlify-cli insists on a Deno binary for its edge-functions proxy (we have
  none) — the npm `deno` devDependency satisfies it in sandboxes where
  dl.deno.land is blocked.
- Render check: `node tools/render-check.mjs` against the running dev server —
  executes each page's JS in jsdom and asserts chart rows, group cards,
  bracket cards, champion box, and zero page errors. Run it after touching
  any page; it caught nothing less than everything string-patching broke.
- Test proxy: `curl http://localhost:8888/api/chances` (or the deployed
  `https://<site>.netlify.app/api/chances`).
- Deploy: push to `main` → Netlify auto-deploys (site imported from this repo).
- Netlify Drop is NOT usable (no functions support).

## Owner
Kit (kmanby) — Saints CC captain. Prefers being told trade-offs straight,
likes the gold-trim branding, will spot a wrong cap number at forty paces.
